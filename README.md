### General
The goal of the game is to get out in the minimum number of steps.

### Config
There is a config file called 'roomsConfig.txt' where you can enter as many lines of room descriptions as you want which will be used to create a maximally balanced tree of rooms.

### Randomness
Each time the game is run, rooms will be assigned randomly so the path to the exit that once worked will not work again.

### Score Calculation
The less steps it takes the player to escape the better they did.
Steps include going left, right, and back.

### Rooms
Each room has a name and a description. Rooms will connect to at most 3 other rooms (left, right, back). There is a starting room that the player begin in and an end room that when entered, concludes the game.

### Controls
Players move by typing certain commands. 
B = Back, L = Left, R = Right, and if you get too scared playing our game then enter Q to quit.


Good luck in your escape and enjoy playing **The Cave**.
