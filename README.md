#The Cave

The goal of the game is to get out in the minimum number of steps
Steps include going left, right, and back

There is a config file called 'roomsConfig.txt' where you can enter as many lines of room descriptions as you want which will be used to create a maximally balanced tree of rooms (nodes)

Each time the game is run, rooms will be assigned randomly so the path to the exit that once worked will not work again

We created a text base adventure game where our main character, you, get to to traverse a cave.
Our character can traverse in three directions back, right, and left to find the exit. 
Each room has a description that will give the player a more imersive feeling while they enjoy our wonderful text base game.
With that they get a name of the room.
Each time the player enters the room, they will see a hint which tells them whether they have been there before.
Players move by pressing typing certain commands. 
B = Back, L = Left, R = Right, and if you get too scared playing our game then enter Q to quit

 Good luck in your escape and enjou playing The Cave.
