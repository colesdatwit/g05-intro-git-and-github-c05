We created a text base adventure game where our main character, you, get to to traverse a cave.
Our character can traverse in three directions back, right, and left to find the exit. 
Each room has a description that will give the player a more imersive feeling while they enjoy our wonderful text base game.
With that they get a name of the room.
They name will help the player traverse back if they get lost in their search for the exit.
Players move by pressing typing certain commands. 
B = Back, L = Left, R = Right, and if you get too scared playing our game then enter Q to quit

 Good luck in your escape and enjou playing The Cave.
