The goal of the game is to get out in the minimum number of steps
Steps include going left, right, and back

There is a config file called 'roomsConfig.txt' where you can enter as many lines of room descriptions as you want which will be used to create a maximally balanced tree of rooms (nodes)

Each time the game is run, rooms will be assigned randomly so the path to the exit that once worked will not work again
